Code highlight fails in JetBrains PyCharm on Jinja template with Babel placeholders.

Babel uses _() function to translate text in Jinja2 templates.
Simple function is highlighted ok, but function with placeholder fails.
PyCharm takes first right bracket as a bracket that completes function _().
You don't need to run code, just see test.html in PyCharm.
